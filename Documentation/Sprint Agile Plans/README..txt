Sprint Folder

This folder contains sprint documentation.

The first document sprintV00 contains the sprint plan for the project. After each sprint the documentation will be updated for the current sprint and uploaded to this folder with a new version number.

For example: after Sprint 1 the whole document will be updated and saved as sprintV01.

The sprint plan is loosely based on the Agile methodology. So it is expected that the next planned sprint will change and require updating.

The sprint plans references the moscow document, which can be found in the Moscow Analysis Folder.
